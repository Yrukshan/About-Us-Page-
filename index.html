                        Planning your dream wedding can be overwhelming, but finding the perfect hotel accommodations for your guests shouldn't be.

                        <b>Effortless Choice:</b> Our advanced search filters allow you to narrow down your options based on location, budget, guest count, amenities (think: spa, pool, group discounts!), and even wedding-specific features like dedicated event staff.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Informed Decisions:</b> Each hotel listing provides detailed information, including high-quality photos, guest reviews, and wedding-specific details like block booking options.

                        "My husband and I had our destination wedding planned with CherishBooking.com. We had the privilege of working with throughout the planning process.
                        We chose to have our wedding at Galle beach hotel in Galle, Sri Lanka, based on pricing.
                        The planning process went a lot smoother than I expected. Planning with the coordinator at the resort was very simple;
                        we were sent a few Word documents to go through and select from a "menu" of decor, food, etc. We then just added everything to the master Excel file, and our coordinator took care of the rest.
                        We brought some decorations in order to save on some expenses but decided to pay for others that we really wanted. We met with our coordinator a few days before the wedding to go over everything,
                        and then on the day of the wedding, it all happened as planned. This exceeded our expectations in every way possible. I would recommend a destination wedding to anyone if they are looking for a 
                        simple planning process, as well as a more cost-effective wedding. We could be happier with how everything turned out."

                        First, we selected a hotel through Cherish Booking.
                        We had the MOST amazing time at the Secrets resort in Kandy for our wedding in late July 2023.
                        Our specialist was Maggie, and she was just great! Always extremely timely in response time,
                        as well as advocating for us to get perks from the resort.
                        We loved our experience! I will say that I was nervous with what felt like a lot of unknowns from not visiting the resort ahead of time,
                        but all of the thorough information Maggie provided really did help subside those nerves! The resort's staff was so friendly and welcoming that you really felt like it was a second home.
                        The photographer really made us feel comfortable as well!
